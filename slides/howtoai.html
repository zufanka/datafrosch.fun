						## Today
						---
						## We will
						- **build a practical understanding** of large language models
						- **explore** the uses and caveats
						- **excercise** some techniques and tools
						---
						## We won't
						- discuss **energy consumption**
						---
						👀 = recommended reading
						---
						## ⁉️ Questions are welcome any time
						---
						## Building understanding
						---
						### Language
						---
						#### 👉 **AI**
						Broad application of machine learning, has been around for decades
						---
						#### 👉 **Language models**
						- also: chat bots, LLM
						- most *recent* breakthrough that has been forced upon us from everywhere
						- still *new*: used in weird ways, misunderstood
						- prime time for *experiments* 🧪
						---
						### LLMs vs journalism
						---
						#### Problems & fears
						- Exploiting content **without paying for it**
						- **Google Zero**
						- **Energy consumption**
						- **Privacy**
						- **Bias** : lack of transparency around training data and other processes
						---
						- **Misinformation and bias at scale**
						- **Manipulated content** : not knowing what is real anymore
						- 👉 **Reduced trust in journalism** 
						---
						#### It's not all bad

						- 👩‍💻 + 🤖🤖🤖🤖 = 💣
						---
						### So how does this work?
						---
						**Word predictor**: what is statistically most probable next token?
						---
						![](img/robotfridgemagnets.png)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						✅ **Multilingual tasks**: Translation, cross-lingual search<br>
						✅ **Summarization** of long documents<br>
						✅ **Explaining complex topics**<br>
						✅ **Explaining code**<br>
						✅ **Simulating perspectives**: Role-playing<br>
						---
						❌ **Genuine novelty**: no truly original ideas<br>
						❌ **Factual reliability**: present false information with confidence<br>
						❌ **Knowing what they don't know**: rarely say "I have no idea"<br>
						❌ **Consistent reasoning**: contradictions<br>
						❌ **Subjective judgment**: don't know what is 'most interesting'<br>
						❌ **Training data cutoffs**: don't know about recent events<br>
						---
						🙏<span style="color: #FF6B6B;">~~GENERAL SEARCH~~</span>🥹
						---
						**Transformer**: taking input and transforming it into something else
						---
						![](img/robottransformer.png)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						✅ **Rewording**, adjusting tone<br>
						✅ **Generating code** from natural language<br>
						✅**Entity & Relationship extraction**: Identifying people, organizations, locations, mapping connections between entities (NER but better)<br>
						✅ **OCR**: tabula but better<br>
						✅ **Data cleaning**<br>
						✅ **Format conversion** : text into tables, csv into JSON, changing data formats<br>
						✅ **Pattern detection**<br>
						---
						❌ **Data analysis** : don't have them do analysis! Have them write the code to do the analysis.
						---
						**A traveller in vector space**: exploring possibilities
						---
						![](img/travelerinvectorspace.jpg)
						[https://jku-vds-lab.at](https://jku-vds-lab.at/apps/embedding-structure-explorer/)
						---
						### Brainstorming
						✅ **Ideation**: Generating many plausible options quickly<br>
						✅ **Producing first drafts** such as interview questions, or FOIA requests<br>
						✅ **Exploring strategies** in for example code, research<br>
						---
						### Important!
						❗They are **eager to please** and therefore your biggest echo chamber<br>
						❗The ability to **question**, **verify**, and **contextualize** information is still *yours*<br>
						---
						### Challenges
						- Find **small tasks** to save time
						- Create **verifiable** workflows
						---
						![](img/euuncovered.jpg)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						#### Issues
						- language barrier
						- large time investment
						---
						- **Concrete** small issue, part of a **larger workflow**
						- Potential *high gains*: time!
						---

						- 🤖 written with claude
						- pulls 2000 articles from 100 RSS feeds every week
						- exctracts 20-30 relevant articles (🤖 semantic understanding)
						- sends a weekly email with the selection
						---
						### ✅
						- sources accross many languages
						- links to the original publication for fact-checks
						- saves time
						---
						#### ❗
						- unknown bias
						- sources still limited (by having an RSS feed)
						- only half of the job
						---
						> Disclaimer: This digest was generated automatically with AI. It **will contain errors and misinterpretations**. Please **always fact-check** with the original publications.

						## Models
						---
						### General purpose models
						GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA, ...
						---
						#### Differences
						- Parameters, speed, system prompt, training data, output, thinking, context window, price, ...

						---
						*Claude*<br>
						![](img/scraperblocking-claude.jpg)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						Training data + system prompt = **different behavior**
						---
						### Specialized models
						---
						#### 🤗 Huggingface
						- selection of open source specialized models
						- [huggingface.co/spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
						- [huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)
						---
						#### Example: One shot classifier
						[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Y62tXx0K4l4QMZs17KQhD_neUjJ7J1YT#scrollTo=55U3yeIBtCRV)
						---
						## Prompting
						---
						#### Vocabulary
						- prompt
						- context
						---
						##### Prompt
						---
						###### What makes a good prompt
						---
						![](img/goodprompt.png)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						![](img/goodprompt2.jpg)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						##### System prompt
						---
						![](img/systemprompt.png)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						![](img/systemprompt2.png)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						##### Context
						---
						‼️ Not to confuse with *context window*
						- *context*: the current 'conversation' including system prompt, prompts and answers
						- *context window*: how much tokens fit in the context
						---
						![](img/contextusage.jpg)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->						
						---
						#### Exercise 1 (*10 min*): [Prompting](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19AwDoV0jydKmpN3V2KGYbm8BRDpL5sug)
						---
						#### Resolution : The meta-prompt
						---
						> "I am an investigative journalist looking into land ownership. I want to get structured output from this document including the names of owners, share of ownership etc. Based on this document and what I need to extract, *write me a reusable prompt* I can use for future cadastral extracts."
						---
						#### For best results on moderately complex tasks
						1. Have a **conversation**
						2. Ask questions, tell it to ask you **clarifying questions**
						3. **At the end** of the conversation ask for a prompt
						4. **Start a new** conversation with the prompt so you start with a *clean context*

						Free and good: 🍌 [Gemini nano banana](https://gemini.google.com/app)
						---
						## Tools for researchers
						- 🔍 Research
						- RAG
						---
						### 🔍 Research
						- LLM searches the web and creates a research report *including sources*
						- **Gemini**, GPT, Claude, [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
						---
						### Pros
						- results are **verifiable**
						- might find **new** sources that complement your web search
						- writes a **summary** of the findings
						---
						### Cons
						- it will **miss** some content (paywalls for example)
						- unknown **biases** in source selection
						---
						#### Example: [History of media ownership in Czechia](https://gemini.google.com/app/57926aeca4831ade)
						---
						### RAG
						(Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 
						---
						- uses LLM as a **search engine**
						- connected to **selected external knowledge** sources
						- finds **relevant chunks** of text and generate answers
						- up-to-date and more trustworthy
						---
						![](img/rag.webp)
						---
						### What NOT to ask a RAG system
						---
						#### Exhaustive listing requests
						❌ List *all* owners in these documents<br>
						❌ Give me *every* address mentioned<br>
						❌ Extract *all* dates from the documents<br>
						- RAG retrieves the *most relevant chunks*, not all chunks.
						---
						#### Counting and statistics
						❌ *How many* properties have hidden ownership?<br>
						❌ *What percentage* of owners are companies vs individuals?<br>
						❌ Count the *total number* of unique addresses<br>
						- RAG *can't aggregate* across all documents
						---
						#### Structured data export
						❌ *Create a CSV of all* properties with their owners and addresses<br>
						❌ *Make a table of every* ownership percentage in all documents<br>
						- RAG retrieves only the most relevant chunks, and can't aggregate
						---
						#### Exercise 2 (*15 min*): [NotebookLM](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/173guQQwdax1RTinZfufsAnENEtl5GQqj)
						---
						## Coding
						- writing code in natural language
						- **scrapers**, **data analysis** (write code, don't have it analyse data), **custom tools**...
						- **pro tip**: conversations + meta-prompting *all the way*, keep your context clean
						---
						### Custom tools
						- Making small tools **focused on 1 task**
						---
						#### Examples:
						- [Chosing colors for data visualisations](https://datafrosch.fun/blog/color-palettes-for-data-visualization.html) 👉🏾 [Color Analyzer](https://datafrosch.fun/color-analyzer.html) 🎨
						- Automated online searches
						---
						## Interfaces
						---
						### Chat window

						### APIs
						- To use from code
						- Paid per request/token
						---
						### Claude Code / Codex
						- Give the LLM control of your computer - very powerful 🏋🏿🦸🏻‍♂️
						- Requires monthly subscription
						---
						## 🙅🏼 How NOT to use LLMs
						---
						- **For direct quotes and attribution**: They hallucinate information by design
						---
						- **Sensitive sources**: Never input information that could identify confidential sources, whistleblowers, or vulnerable people
						---
						- **Anything you wouldn't want leaked**: Assume anything you paste could appear in training data or logs
						---
						## 🫣 When privacy is really important
						---
						Try local models with [ollama](https://ollama.com/) or [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/)
						- **Pros**: free, local (nothing gets sent out, privacy friendly)
						- **Cons**: often more slow & stupid OR very big (e.g. [DeepSeek v3](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-v3): 404 GB)
						---

						---
						![](img/huggingfacemodels.jpg)
						[huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models)
						<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->
						---
						- ... or just **ask a language model** what is the best model for the task
						---
						## 🪙 Most things cost money
						---
						- You will hit **limitation without a subscription**
						- For API's you need **credits**
						- Claude code / codex require subscriptions
						- Cheapest API for a good model: DeepSeek
						- free API calls via [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) (incl. sacrificing all the privacy)

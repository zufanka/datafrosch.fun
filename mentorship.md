## Testimonials
"When Ada was assigned to mentor my team on a recent cross-border investigation, I had little grasp of what data journalism really entailed — let alone how it could become central to my reporting. Under her guidance, I quickly learned the essentials, from the value of “tidy data” to uncovering stories in pivot tables. More importantly, I came to see that data journalism is not about decorating articles with charts, but a holistic approach to unearthing truths and telling impactful stories. Ada was the ideal mentor — always available, responsive to our needs and deeply attuned to the dynamics of our project. She moulded our investigation more than anyone else, and has fundamentally reshaped my long-term approach to journalism." - James Imam, Freelance investigative reporter

""What is it you want to do?" From this starting point, conversations with Adriana are about more than just code and technical skills but about taking a systematic approach, thinking through the steps to reach a solution, regardless of your preferred coding language or whether you're a fan of Excel or Google Sheets. Whether it's solving a specific task or building entire data pipelines or databases, basic or complex, it's always enjoyable to work through it together. In mentoring sessions, Adriana shares her vast experience of all matters data and visualisations, and always finds the time to send resources and ideas to accompany one's research. Adriana's advice has stayed with me to this day, five years after first meeting her as a teacher in a data journalism class, as have the jokes we shared." - Sarah Pilz, Freelance Data Journalist
